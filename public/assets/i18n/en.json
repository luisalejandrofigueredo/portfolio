  "ABOUT_TEXT": "Hello, let me introduce myself — I’m a computer enthusiast with many years of experience in the field. I’m currently working with Angular for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. I’ve been involved in computing since I was a teenager; my first computer was a ZX Spectrum, on which I started programming in BASIC. Later, I studied Systems Analysis and worked with many languages such as Clarion, Cobol, and Clipper under D.O.S, then moved on to Windows programming. Working for newspapers gave me experience in graphic design and helped me transition quickly into web development. Additionally, I’d like to mention that I’m the creator of the ng-gd library for Angular.",
